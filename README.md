## What is GitQuest?

GitQuest is a **zero-install, browser-only** Git learning game with four structured learning paths. It balances **concepts, real-world scenarios, and hands-on CLI practice** — so learners build the muscle memory and intuition that transfers to any tool or team.

```
Open index.html → Tell us about yourself → Pick your path → Start learning
```

No Node.js. No npm. No build step. No sign-up. One folder, open in a browser.

---

## Why GitQuest?

- ✅ **Personalised from the start** — examples adapt to your background (school, uni, work, or self-taught) in *every* step type, not just story steps
- ✅ **Story-driven** — narrative characters guide you through each chapter with typewriter speech bubbles
- ✅ **Crisis scenarios** — real incidents with multiple resolution choices and live consequences
- ✅ **Hands-on CLI practice** — type real git commands in the simulated terminal; tasks tick off in real time
- ✅ **Honest quiz system** — 3 attempts per question, hints, and answer reveal after 3 wrong
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** — pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- ✅ **Works offline** — after first load, everything runs in your browser

## Life-Stage Personalisation

When you start GitQuest you choose your background — and the examples adapt **throughout every lesson**, not just story steps:

| Stage | Who it's for | Example scenario |
|---|---|---|
| 🏫 **High School** | Students in CS or IT class | "Me and Jamie are editing the same file — Git tracks every version so nobody overwrites each other." |
| 🎓 **University** | Undergrads / postgrads | "Our 4-person team is all pushing to the same repo — branches and PRs keep the chaos in order." |
| 💼 **Working Professional** | Developers in a team | "My manager said 'don't break main' — here's exactly how the branching workflow protects it." |
| 🌱 **Self-Taught / Hobbyist** | Personal projects, tutorials | "I deleted my entire project by accident. Never again — here's your permanent undo button." |

Personalisation covers three layers:
- **Story steps** — narrative context and character dialogue
- **Concept steps** — a "Your World" example box showing the concept through a lens from your life
- **Terminal practice steps** — the scenario framing matches your background

You can change your background at any time from the Profile screen.

## Crisis Scenarios

GitQuest includes **7 real-world incident scenarios** that drop you into a crisis and ask: *what do you do?*

| Lesson | Incident |
|---|---|
| Beginner 4 | 🔑 AWS secret key committed to main — GitHub Secret Scanner fires 45 seconds later |
| Beginner 5 | 🕒 Three days of feature work done on main, no branch — lead is asking where the PR is |
| Beginner 7 | 💥 Wrong branch merged to main — homepage is blank, alerts firing |
| Intermediate 1 | 🔥 Production 500s on payments — full hotfix runbook (9 steps) |
| Intermediate 3 | 🔀 Interactive rebase squashed a colleague's commits — she's asking where they went |
| Expert 1 | 🔍 47 tests failing, 200 commits since last green — git bisect to the rescue |
| Expert 3 | 🪝 Pre-commit hook takes 4 minutes — whole team is using `--no-verify` |

Each crisis has **3–4 resolution choices**, each with a real-world outcome story (correct, dangerous, or wrong). Correct resolution awards a **+25 XP bonus**.

---

## Quiz System

- **3 attempts per question** — attempt dots show how many tries remain
- **Progressive hints** — hint appears after 1st wrong answer, stronger hint after 2nd
- **Answer reveal** — after 3 failed attempts, the correct answer is shown in a blue panel with full explanation
- **Real-world consequences** — wrong answers show what actually happens in a real codebase
- **Skip = 50% XP** — move past a quiz without answering to keep momentum; earn the other half when you return
- **CLI-focused questions** — command-syntax questions balance conceptual multiple choice throughout all paths

## How to Add a New Lesson

Lessons are pure JavaScript objects in `js/data.js`. No tooling required.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full lesson schema and a step-by-step guide.

**Quick example — a minimal lesson:**

```javascript
{
  id: 'b11', num: 11, icon: '🔖', xp: 120,
  title: 'Git Aliases',
  subtitle: 'Create shortcuts for common commands',
  type: 'interactive',
  tip: 'git config --global alias.st status  →  now "git st" works!',
  commands: [
    { cmd: 'git config --global alias.st status', desc: 'Create an alias' }
  ],
  gitState: { commits: [], branches: { main: null }, HEAD: 'main' },
  steps: [
    {
      type: 'story',
      title: 'Working Smarter',
      context: 'You type git status 50 times a day. What if it was just git st?',
      objective: '🎯 Create git aliases to speed up your daily workflow'
    },
    {
      type: 'quiz',
      questions: [{
        q: 'How do you create a global alias "co" for "checkout"?',
        options: [
          'git alias co checkout',
          'git config --global alias.co checkout',
          'git shortcut co=checkout',
          'alias co="git checkout"'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        hint: 'Aliases live in ~/.gitconfig — the command that writes there starts with git config --global',
        explanation: '✅ git config --global alias.co checkout stores the alias in ~/.gitconfig'
      }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Adding a terminal practice step** — inject into any existing lesson via `js/data-commands.js`:

```javascript
// In js/data-commands.js  (inside the patchCommands IIFE)
addSteps('beginner', 'b11', [
  {
    type: 'terminal-practice',
    title: 'Practice: Create a Git Alias',
    context: 'Set up two aliases and verify they work.',
    contexts: {
      school:  'Speed up your workflow before your next project deadline.',
      uni:     'Your whole team uses git st — now so do you.',
      learner: 'Aliases save dozens of keystrokes every day.',
      working: 'Standard aliases every senior dev has in their .gitconfig.'
    },
    tasks: [
      {
        instruction: 'Create a "st" alias for git status',
        command: 'git config --global alias.st status',
        acceptPartial: false,
        hint: 'Type: git config --global alias.st status',
        successMsg: '✅ Alias created — "git st" now works globally'
      },
      {
        instruction: 'Verify the alias works',
        command: 'git st',
        acceptPartial: false,
        hint: 'Type: git st  (your new alias)',
        successMsg: '✅ Alias works perfectly!'
      }
    ]
  }
]);
```

**Adding a crisis scenario** — inject into any existing lesson without touching `data.js`:

```javascript
// In js/data-practical.js
patch('beginner', 'b11', [{
  type: 'crisis',
  title: '🚨 INCIDENT: Wrong alias deleted all my commits',
  urgency: 'medium',
  situation: 'You aliased "git nuke" to "git reset --hard HEAD~10". A teammate ran it.',
  clue: 'git reflog shows every position HEAD has ever been at',
  choices: [
    { label: 'git reflog → git reset --hard HEAD@{1}', outcome: 'correct', result: '...' },
    { label: 'Panic and email the team', outcome: 'wrong', result: '...' }
  ]
}]);
```

**Adding life-stage concept examples** — add to the `LIFESTAGE_EXAMPLES` object in `js/data-commands.js`:

```javascript
// Key format: `${persona}_${levelId}_${stepIndex}`
// stepIndex is the 0-based index of the concept step within the lesson
window.LIFESTAGE_EXAMPLES.school['beginner_b11_1'] =
  'Your teacher is impressed you typed git st instead of the full command. Small habits = big efficiency gains.';
```

### Branch Workflow

`main` is the protected branch — all changes go through a PR:

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes, commit them
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: describe what you did"

# 3. Push and open a PR
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
gh pr create   # requires GitHub CLI — cli.github.com
```

**Branch naming convention:**

| Prefix | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feature/` | New lessons, features, personas |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes |
| `content/` | Lesson text, crisis scenarios, life-stage variants |
| `style/` | CSS / visual changes only |
| `chore/` | CI, config, tooling |
